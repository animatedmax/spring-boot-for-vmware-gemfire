# Spring Boot for GemFire documentation

[Last updated 10/31/2022]

Converted October 2022 from Spring Boot GemFire asciidoc sources.

At the time of first checkin:

- Docs build successfully in DocWorks
- Many links are badly formatted
- Many links point to Spring Geode docs and should be redirected to Spring GemFire docs
- Many links are invalid and need correcting
